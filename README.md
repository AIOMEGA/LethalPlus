# LethalPlus

LethalPlus adds many new features to Lethal Company (Currently only adds 1 functional feature)

## Features

### BeeHive Discombobulation

- **Functionality**: Using a Spray Paint on a BeeHive triggers a unique effect. The bees become discombobulated for a short time allowing you to run off with the hive.

#### How it Works
- Run to a Hive and distract the Bees then quickly run to the Hive and spray it.
- If you didn't miss the Bees will slow down and calm down for a short period.
- Note: If you spray a Hive but then Spray something else the effect wears off.

*Stay tuned for more features and updates as LethalPlus evolves!*
